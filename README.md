- Hello I am @vwgeiser, currently a Senior undergraduate at Saint Louis University
- I’m interested in the interaction between Meteorology, Atmospheric Chemistry and Machine Learning
- I’m currently learning how to use machine learning to predict VOC concentrations in the atmosphere
- I’m looking to collaborate on the code used in the above project and creating a code base so that there is a lower barrier to entry into machine learning and linear regression
- How to reach me. I work best over email: vwgeiser@gmail.com
